# EmansToolkit

Personal proejct over the summer of 2016 to brush up my skills before my placement. This program essentially contains all helpful functions and tools that I may need when on my computer, doing this makes all my needs easy to access. 

I will be using Java for this with various frameworks. This will be an ungoing project. I will always be updating and adding changes to this project.

Essentially how this works is that there will be a 'main screen'. In that screen there is a textbox to put commands. These commands represent different programs or tools. So for example entering 'txt' and pressing enter on the main screen will load up my personal notepad. 

####**Version 1.0**
 - Implemented my personal Grade Calculator.  
 - Added Password validation incase I want to protect any sensitive data. 
 - Implemented a custom Notepad I built. (Save/Load functionality added).
