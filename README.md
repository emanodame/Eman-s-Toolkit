# EmansToolkit

Personal project over the summer of 2016 to brush up my skills before my placement. This program essentially contains all helpful functions and tools that I may need when on my computer, doing this makes all my needs easy to access.

This will be a program I will keep working on indefinitely. As I learn more at Uni/Placement I will be applying those skills to this program making it more advanced.

Essentially how this works is that there will be a 'main screen'. In that screen there is a textbox to put commands. These commands represent different programs or tools. So for example entering 'txt' and pressing enter on the main screen will load up my personal notepad.
